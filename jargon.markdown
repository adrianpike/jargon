**Drug Report** &mdash; a report so utterly incomprehensible that whoever 
submitted it must have been smoking crack. The lesser version is a chug 
report, where the submitter is thought to have had one too many.

**Shrug Report** &mdash; a bug report with no error message or repro steps
 and only a vague description of the problem. Usually contains the phrase 
 "doesn't work." [Aaronaught](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2353466)

**Smug Report** &mdash; a bug submitted by a user who thinks he knows a lot
more about the system's design than he really does. Filled with irrelevant
technical details and one or more suggestions (always wrong) about what he
thinks is causing the problem and how we should fix it.

**Pok√©mon Exception Handling** &mdash; For when you just Gotta Catch 'Em
All. [John K](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2349399)

**Yoda Conditions** &mdash; using if(constant == variable) instead of 
if(variable == constant), like if(4 == foo). Because it's like saying "if
blue is the sky" or "if tall is the man".
